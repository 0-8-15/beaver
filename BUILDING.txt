Building ZeroTier One on different platforms:

(See RUNNING.txt for what to do next.)

Developers note: there is currently no management of dependencies on *nix
platforms, so you should make clean ; make if you change a header. Will
do this eventually.

-- MacOS

make -f Makefile.mac

Edit Makefile.mac if you want to change between debug or release build.

-- Linux

make -f Makefile.linux

Edit Makefile.linux if you want to change between debug or release build.

-- Windows

Right now Windows builds using Visual Studio 2012. Technically it should also
build with other tools, but VS2012 is what your author is using.

Load the ZeroTierOne.sln solution. Typically you won't need to worry about
any projects other than ZeroTierOne, Service, and InstallerUpdater. SelfTest
builds the selftest program which can be used to test many aspects of the
core code base. TapDriver builds the Ethernet tap driver, which shouldn't
be something end users need to do and requires a driver signing key to create
a publishable driver that users can load without big red warnings.

To just test ZeroTier One itself, build ZeroTierOne and run the binary in
an administrator-mode command window.

Instructions for doing a full build will be forthcoming once all the details
are worked out. Windows is still a work in progress.
