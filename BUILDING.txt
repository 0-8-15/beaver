Building ZeroTier One on different platforms:

(See RUNNING.txt for what to do next.)

Developers note: there is currently no management of dependencies on *nix
platforms, so you should make clean ; make if you change a header. Will
do this eventually.

-- MacOS

make -f Makefile.mac

Edit Makefile.mac if you want to change between debug or release build.

-- Linux

make -f Makefile.linux

Edit Makefile.linux if you want to change between debug or release build.

If you are building ext/tap-mac you will need a different version of the
OSX gcc compiler chain than what currently ships (clang). We've got a copy
available here:

http://download.zerotier.com/dev/llvm-g++-Xcode4.6.2.tar.bz2

Un-tar this into ext/ (it's excluded in .gitignore) and then 'make' in
ext/tap-mac/tuntap/src/tap.

Most users should not need to build tap-mac, since a binary is included
in ext/bin.

-- Windows

Here be dragons.
