Building ZeroTier One on different platforms:

(See RUNNING.txt for what to do next.)

Developers note: there is currently no management of dependencies on *nix
platforms, so you should make clean ; make if you change a header. Will
do this eventually.

-- Linux

make

That's it. Add ZT_AUTO_UPDATE=1 to the make command line to build an
auto-update-enabled version that will update from ZeroTier's servers.
This is disabled by default since such a build will automatically
replace itself with our binary distributions.

-- MacOS

make

The same ZT_AUTO_UPDATE=1 option as Linux supports can be used here to
build an auto-update-enabled version. By default auto-updates are not
enabled.

If you are building ext/tap-mac you will need a different version of the
OSX gcc compiler chain than what currently ships (clang). We've got a copy
available here:

http://download.zerotier.com/dev/llvm-g++-Xcode4.6.2.tar.bz2

Un-tar this into ext/ (it's excluded in .gitignore) and then 'make' in
ext/tap-mac/tuntap/src/tap.

Most users should not need to build tap-mac, since a binary is included
in ext/bin.

To build the UI you will need Qt version 5.0 or later. The Qt home must
be symbolically linked into "Qt" in the parent directory of the ZeroTier
One source tree. Then you can type "make mac-ui" and the UI should build.
You can also load the UI in Qt Creator and build/test it that way.

-- Windows

Here be dragons.
