This directory is for old code that isn't used but we don't want to lose track of, and for anything else random like debug scripts.

Some stuff other than shelved code:

multicast-trace-receiver.rb: receives multicast trace UDP packets from ZT_TRACE_MULTICAST
encrypt, decrypt: useful shell scripts for AES-encrypting and decrypting files
