This is the Microsoft "devcon" utility, which as far as I know is
fair game to redistribute. It's packaged with OpenVPN and several
other things and also distributed in source code form as an example
program by Microsoft.

It's used to automatically install the Microsoft Loopback Adapter
or remove it when no longer needed.
