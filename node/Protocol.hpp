 * Packet format:
 *   <[8] 64-bit packet ID / crypto IV>
 *   <[5] destination ZT address>
 *   <[5] source ZT address>
 *   <[1] flags/cipher/hops>
 *   <[8] 64-bit MAC (or trusted path ID in trusted path mode)>
 *   [... -- begin encryption envelope -- ...]
 *   <[1] encrypted flags (MS 3 bits) and verb (LS 5 bits)>
 *   [... verb-specific payload ...]
 *
 * Packets smaller than 28 bytes are invalid and silently discarded.
 *
 * The flags/cipher/hops bit field is: FFCCCHHH where C is a 3-bit cipher
 * selection allowing up to 7 cipher suites, F is outside-envelope flags,
 * and H is hop count.
 *
 * The three-bit hop count is the only part of a packet that is mutable in
 * transit without invalidating the MAC. All other bits in the packet are
 * immutable. This is because intermediate nodes can increment the hop
 * count up to 7 (protocol max).
 *
 * For unencrypted packets, MAC is computed on plaintext. Only HELLO is ever
 * sent in the clear, as it's the "here is my public key" message.
 *
 * The fragmented bit indicates that there is at least one fragment. Fragments
 * themselves contain the total, so the receiver must "learn" this from the
 * first fragment it receives.
 *
 * Fragments are sent with the following format:
 *   <[8] packet ID of packet to which this fragment belongs>
 *   <[5] destination ZT address>
 *   <[1] 0xff here signals that this is a fragment>
 *   <[1] total fragments (most significant 4 bits), fragment no (LS 4 bits)>
 *   <[1] ZT hop count (least significant 3 bits; others are reserved)>
 *   <[...] fragment data>
 *
 * The protocol supports a maximum of 16 fragments. If a fragment is received
 * before its main packet header, it should be cached for a brief period of
 * time to see if its parent arrives. Loss of any fragment constitutes packet
 * loss; there is no retransmission mechanism. The receiver must wait for full
 * receipt to authenticate and decrypt; there is no per-fragment MAC. (But if
 * fragments are corrupt, the MAC will fail for the whole assembled packet.)
