	 * Process a fragment of a multi-part message
	 *
	 * The message ID is arbitrary but must be something that can uniquely
	 * group fragments for a given final message. The total fragments expected
	 * value is expectded to be the same for all fragments in a message. Results
	 * are undefined and probably wrong if this value changes across a message.
	 * Fragment numbers must be sequential starting with 0 and going up to
	 * one minus total fragments expected (non-inclusive range).
	 *
	 * Fragments can arrive in any order. Duplicates are dropped and ignored.
	 *
	 * It's the responsibility of the caller to do whatever validation needs to
	 * be done before considering a fragment valid and to make sure the fragment
	 * data index and size parameters are valid.
	 *
	 * The fragment supplied to this function is kept and held under the supplied
	 * message ID until or unless (1) the message is fully assembled, (2) the
	 * message is orphaned and its entry is taken by a new message, or (3) the
	 * clear() function is called to forget all incoming messages. The pointer
	 * at the 'fragment' reference will be zeroed since this pointer is handed
	 * off, so the SharedPtr<> passed in as 'fragment' will be NULL after this
	 * function is called.
	 *
	 * The result returned by this function is a structure containing a series
	 * of assembled and complete fragments, a fragment count, and an error.
	 * If the message fragment count is non-zero then the message has been
	 * successfully assembled. If the fragment count is zero then an error may
	 * have occurred or the message may simply not yet be complete.
	 *
	 * The calling code must decide what to do with the assembled and ordered
	 * fragments, such as memcpy'ing them into a contiguous buffer or handling
	 * them as a vector of fragments.
	 *
	 * The 'via' parameter causes this fragment to be registered with a path and
	 * unregistered when done or abandoned. It's only used the first time it's
	 * supplied (the first non-NULL) for a given message ID. This is a mitigation
	 * against memory exhausting DOS attacks.
	 *
	 * Lastly the message queue size target and GC trigger parameters control
	 * garbage collection of defragmenter message queue entries. If the size
	 * target parameter is non-zero then the message queue is cleaned when its
	 * size reaches the GC trigger parameter, which MUST be larger than the size
	 * target. Cleaning is done by sorting all entries by their last modified
	 * timestamp and removing the oldest N entries so as to bring the size down
	 * to under the size target. The use of a trigger size that is larger than
	 * the size target reduces CPU-wasting thrashing. A good value for the trigger
	 * is 2X the size target, causing cleanups to happen only occasionally.
	 *
	 * If the GC parameters are set to zero then clear() must be called from time
	 * to time or memory use will grow without bound.
	 *
	 * @tparam X Template parameter type for Buf<> containing fragment (inferred)
	 * @param messageId Message ID (a unique ID identifying this message)
	 * @param fragment Buffer containing fragment that will be filed under this message's ID
	 * @param fragmentDataIndex Index of data in fragment's data.bytes (fragment's data.fields type is ignored)
	 * @param fragmentDataSize Length of data in fragment's data.bytes (fragment's data.fields type is ignored)
	 * @param fragmentNo Number of fragment (0..totalFragmentsExpected, non-inclusive)
	 * @param totalFragmentsExpected Total number of expected fragments in this message
	 * @param now Current time
	 * @param via If non-NULL this is the path on which this message fragment was received
	 * @param maxIncomingFragmentsPerPath If via is non-NULL this is a cutoff for maximum fragments in flight via this path
	 * @param messageQueueSizeTarget If non-zero periodically clean the message queue to bring it under this size
	 * @param messageQueueSizeGCTrigger A value larger than messageQueueSizeTarget that is when cleaning is performed
	 * @return Result buffer (pointer to 'result' or newly allocated buffer) or NULL if message not complete
