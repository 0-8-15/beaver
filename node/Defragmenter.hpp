	 * message ID until or unless (1) the message is fully assembled, (2) the
	 * message is orphaned and its entry is taken by a new message, or (3) the
	 * clear() function is called to forget all incoming messages. The pointer
	 * at the 'fragment' reference will be zeroed since this pointer is handed
	 * off, so the SharedPtr<> passed in as 'fragment' will be NULL after this
	 * function is called.
	 *
	 * The 'via' parameter causes this fragment to be registered with a path and
	 * unregistered when done or abandoned. It's only used the first time it's
	 * supplied (the first non-NULL) for a given message ID. This is a mitigation
	 * against memory exhausting DOS attacks.
