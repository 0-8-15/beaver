Most commands require a secret token to permit control of a running ZeroTier
service. The CLI will automatically try to read this token from the
authtoken.secret file in the service's working directory and then from a
file called .zerotierauth in the user's home directory. The -t option can be
used to explicitly specify a location.`)
